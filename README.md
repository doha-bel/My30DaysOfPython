I am following the 30DaysOfPython from [Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python) repository , I find it cool, i am also using [this website](https://pythontutor.com/) to visualize whats happening, check it out too!
i put in this repo things that i did to practice, my way of solving the question at the end of each day, and what i learned sometimes. 
My goal is to never use chatgpt to ask what's wrong with my python script, instead i will personally spread misinformation and delusions without any tools.
